				<h3>Definition of Fruit</h3>
				<p>Fruit make up a large portion of our diets. Did you know many foods that we consider to be vegetables are actually fruits? The botanical definition of fruit is a seed-bearing part of a flowering plant or tree that can be eaten as food. By those standards, foods such as avocados, cucumbers, squash, and yes, even tomatoes are all fruits. From a culinary viewpoint, a fruit is usually thought of as any sweet-tasting plant product with seeds, whereas a vegetable is any savory or less sweet-tasting plant.</p>
				<h3>Types of Fruit</h3>
				Fruits can be eaten raw, frozen, stewed, cooked, or dried. All fruits may be classified into three major groups: simple, aggregate, or multiple.
				<p><span style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Simple Fruits</span> = one fruit that has developed from the ovary of a single flower. Simple fruits may either be fleshy, like plums and peaches, or dry, such as walnuts and hazelnuts.</p>
				<p><span style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Aggregate Fruits</span> = a fruit formed from several ovaries of one flower that produces many tiny fruits clustered tightly together.</p>
				<p><span style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Multiple Fruits</span> = a fruit formed from the fusion of the ovaries of many different flowers which develop closely together to form one bigger fruit.</p>
				Note: False fruits or accessory fruits are another kind of fruit that is not formed from the ovary, but from a different part of the flower. These fruits may be simple, aggregate, or multiple fruits. For example, strawberries would be considered an aggregate fruit, as well as an accessory fruit since much of the fleshy fruit part does not come from the ovary.
